## Overview

### The challenge

- Build a text-based number guessing game (1–100)
- Include two difficulty levels:
  - **Easy** – 10 attempts  
  - **Hard** – 5 attempts  
- Provide feedback after each guess (“Too High”, “Too Low”)
- Track remaining attempts and end the game when they run out

## Notes

### Tools
- [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) — for stepping through loops and scope

### Built with

- Python

### What I learned

- How to split game logic across **multiple functions**
- How to use a **compare function** to evaluate player guesses
- Understanding **global vs local scope**
- How to update a global value the **clean way** (return → assign)
- Using **constants** and why they matter (e.g., difficulty settings)
- Cleaner flow control using `if / elif` and separate logic groups
