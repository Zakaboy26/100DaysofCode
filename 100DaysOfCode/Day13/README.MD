## Overview

Day 13 focuses entirely on **debugging**, understanding common mistakes, spotting them quickly and learning how to systematically fix code problems.  
These are small exercises meant to improve logic and troubleshooting skills rather than produce final programs.

### Exercises Completed
- 🐛 **Debugging Odd or Even**
- 🐛 **Debugging Leap Year**
- 🐛 **Debugging FizzBuzz**

### Tools
- [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) — used to trace code execution and understand where logic breaks.

### Built with
- Python

### What I learned
- How to **spot logical errors** and incorrect indentation
- How to **reproduce bugs** consistently before fixing them
- Debugging workflow:
  - Describe the problem
  - Reproduce the bug
  - Evaluate each line
  - Use `print()` strategically
  - Use debugging tools for visual step-through
- Gained confidence reading and correcting broken code
