## Day 11 – CAPSTONE Project: Blackjack Game
- Notes: This is my initial solution for the blackjack game. I will review and hopefully improve it in the future.

## Overview

### The challenge

- Build a simple text-based **Blackjack** game using core Python concepts.
- The game must:
  - Deal cards to player and dealer
  - Handle Aces as 11 or 1
  - Allow the player to *Hit* or *Stand*
  - Force the dealer to draw until reaching at least 17
  - Compare results and determine win/lose/draw

This was the **first Capstone project**, combining everything from the earlier days into one larger program.

## Notes

### Built with

- Python

### What I reviewed

- Random Module  
- For Loops  
- Functions  
- Range()  
- While Loops  
- Returning multiple values from functions  
- Basic game loop logic  

### What I learned

- Why recursion is not ideal for game loops  
- How to properly structure functions so they return updated values  
- How to handle busts, blackjack, and comparison logic cleanly  
- Improved debugging and problem-solving skills

📌 **Personal Note:**  
This is my first full game program written in Python. It took several iterations to fix the logic flow (especially drawing cards, handling Aces, and comparing scores).  
I plan to revisit this project in the future to clean it up and make it more efficient as I progress through more advanced Python topics.
