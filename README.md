# 🐍 100 Days of Python

Hello, my name is Zakariya.  
This repository contains my completed Python projects which I'm doing daily as part of the **100 Days of Coding Challenge**.

I’m currently on **Day 15**, and I’m gradually uploading my finished projects here to track my progress and learning journey.  
This repository is still a work in progress.

### 💡 Why Python?

Coming from a **Java (Spring Boot)** background during university, I wanted to expand my programming foundation by learning **Python**, a language known for its versatility across different domains such as **web development**, **automation**, **data analysis**, and **DevOps**.

My **internship exposure to FarmStack** — a Python-based full-stack system — sparked my interest in the language even more.  
Python was used across **backend development**, **automation**, and internal tools, which made me want to understand it deeply and become a more **adaptable, full-stack engineer**.

### 📚 How This Challenge Will Benefit Me

- Strengthen my understanding of **core programming logic** and problem-solving  
- Explore Python’s versatility across **scripting**, **automation**, and backend development  
- Gain experience working with **different OOP paradigms**
