# 🐍 100 Days of Python

Hello, my name is **Zakariya**.  
This repository contains my notes and completed Python exercises which I'm completing daily as part of the **100 Days of Coding Challenge**.

I’m currently on **Day 9**, and I’m gradually uploading my finished projects here to track my progress and learning journey.  
This repository is still a work in progress.

### 💡 Why Python?

Coming from a **Java (Spring Boot)** background during university, I wanted to expand my programming foundation by learning **Python**, a language known for its versatility across different domains such as **web development**, **automation**, **data analysis** and **DevOps**.  

My **internship exposure to FarmStack** (a full-stack framework built on Python) sparked my interest in the language even more.  
At my internship, Python was used **across multiple areas**, from **backend development** to **DevOps automation** and other internal tools.  
Seeing its flexibility in real projects made me want to understand it deeply and use it to become a more **well-rounded and adaptable developer**.

### 📚 How This Challenge Will Benefit Me

- Strengthen my understanding of **core programming logic** and **problem-solving**  
- Explore Python’s versatility across **scripting**, **automation** and **backend development**  
- Broaden my experience working with **different OOP languages and paradigms**
