# 🐍 100 Days of Python

Hello, my name is **Zakariya**.  
This repository contains my notes and completed Python exercises which I'm completing daily as part of the **100 Days of Coding Challenge**.

I’m currently on **Day 8**, and I’m gradually uploading my finished projects here to track my progress and learning journey.  
This repository is still a work in progress.
